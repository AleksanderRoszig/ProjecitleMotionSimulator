# ProjecitleMotionSimulator



Its projectile motion simulator. In first step I used analytical metods to calculate traffic path and the size of vectors
acting on a bullet that is in this case a sphere. Later I want to add ground slope and elastic collision.   
In next step i want to use integral calculation metods for calculating traffic path and numerical methods for calculating 
air resistance. 
Meanwhile, I should make GUI.

Calculations of motion with air resistance are not done yet
